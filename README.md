in order to meet the needs of an end banking user. This project aims to develop an online banking platform for bank customers. The system, an online 
application, is accessible from both within and outside the business with the proper login.The model is divided into three microservices: the login-service,
employee-service, and customer-service, and the project uses a microservices architecture to do this.
